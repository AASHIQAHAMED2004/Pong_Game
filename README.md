# Pong Game

Welcome to the Pong game implemented in Python using the Pygame library! This classic arcade game simulates a table tennis match where players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth.

## Overview

Pong is a simple yet addictive game where two players compete against each other to score points by hitting a ball past their opponent's paddle. The game features basic physics, collision detection, and player input handling.

## Features

- **Player Controls**: Players can control the movement of their paddles using designated keys (W and S for the left player, and the arrow keys for the right player).
- **Scoring System**: The game keeps track of each player's score and displays it on the screen.
- **Winning Condition**: The first player to reach the winning score (default is 10) wins the game.
- **Collision Detection**: The game detects collisions between the ball and the paddles, bouncing the ball back accordingly.
- **Game Over and Restart**: When a player wins, the game displays a winning message, waits for a few seconds, then resets the game for a new match.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library


## How to Play

1. Run the `pong.py` script in a Python environment.
